# Agricultural Insights Dashboard: Karnataka (2004-2019)

### A Data-Driven Analysis of Crop Yield, Resources, and Trends

This project is an in-depth exploratory data analysis of the agricultural sector in Karnataka, India, over a 15-year period. The goal was to identify the key factors influencing crop productivity and present these findings in an interactive dashboard for stakeholders like farmers, policymakers, and researchers.

## Key Findings

This analysis uncovered several key insights critical for understanding and improving agricultural outcomes:

* **Productivity Drivers:** Crop yield is not strictly correlated with rainfall. The analysis shows that **soil type** and **planting season** are more significant predictors of high yields.
* **High-Yield Crops:** **Coconut** and **Ginger** were consistently the highest-yielding crops across the 15-year period.
* **Regional Performance:** Districts like **Mysuru** and **Kodagu** consistently demonstrated superior agricultural output, particularly during the Rabi and Zaid seasons.
* **Data-Driven Strategy:** The dashboard enables users to dynamically filter by crop, location, and season to identify specific opportunities for optimization, guiding strategic decisions in resource allocation and crop selection.
